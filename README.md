# Algorithms Visualizer üìê

## 1- Maze Solver Visualizer üß©

Maze Solver Visualizer is a **Java-based application** that generates and solves mazes using popular pathfinding algorithms like **Depth-First Search (DFS)**, **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**, and **A* (A-star)**. This project provides an interactive interface for visualizing how each algorithm finds its way through a randomly generated maze.

### I wrote an article so that if anyone wants to build something like this or add new things into it:

### üìã Project Overview

This project includes:

- **Maze Generation**: Randomly generates a maze grid that can be solved using **DFS** .
  
- **Pathfinding Algorithms** to solve the maze:
  - **DFS (Depth-First Search)**: Explores paths deeply before backtracking.
  - **BFS (Breadth-First Search)**: Guarantees the shortest path in an unweighted grid.
  - **A\* (A-star)**: Uses heuristics to optimize pathfinding.
    
- **Java Swing UI**: Interactive GUI built with Java Swing to visualize the maze and each algorithm‚Äôs solution path.



# 2. N Queens solver:

The N-Queens puzzle is the problem of placing N chess queens on an N√óN chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. Thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.

This algorithm is designed using recursion.
